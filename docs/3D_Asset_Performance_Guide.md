# Basic 3D Guide for Local Prototype

## 🎯 Project Context

**Auto Customizer Local Prototype** - Simple 3D setup for Windows local development. No optimization required.

## 🖥️ Basic Hardware Requirements

### Simple Requirements

- **Any Windows Machine**: Use whatever you have
- **Any Graphics**: Integrated or dedicated GPU fine
- **RAM**: 4GB+ sufficient for prototype
- **Browser**: Chrome or Firefox
- **Performance Target**: If it works, it's good enough

### Prototype Philosophy

**Just Get It Working**: Focus on functionality, not optimization.

## 🚀 Simple 3D Model Setup

### Basic Model Requirements (No Optimization Needed)

- **Format**: Use .glb files (easier to load)
- **Source**: Download free models from Sketchfab, TurboSquid, or similar
- **Size**: Any size that loads in browser
- **Complexity**: Don't worry about vertex count
- **Textures**: Any format that works

### Simple File Setup

```typescript
// Just put models in public/models/
const models = {
  car1: '/models/car1.glb',
  car2: '/models/car2.glb',
  wheel1: '/models/wheel1.glb'
};

// Basic loading - no optimization needed
const CarModel = ({ modelPath }: { modelPath: string }) => {
  const { scene } = useGLTF(modelPath);
  return <primitive object={scene} />;
};
```

### No Optimization Required

- Don't worry about file sizes
- Don't worry about vertex counts
- Don't worry about texture compression
- Don't worry about LOD or culling
- Just get models loading and displaying!

## 📊 Basic Performance Check

### Simple Performance Goals

- **Desktop**: If it renders without major lag, it's good
- **Mobile**: Not a concern for local prototype
- **Memory**: Don't worry about it
- **Load Times**: As long as it loads eventually

### Basic Performance Check

```typescript
// Simple way to check if things are working
const CarModel = ({ modelPath }: { modelPath: string }) => {
  console.log('Loading model:', modelPath); // Debug info

  const { scene } = useGLTF(modelPath);

  console.log('Model loaded successfully!'); // Success indicator
  return <primitive object={scene} />;
};

// If you see both console messages and a 3D model, you're good!
```

### Simple Troubleshooting

```typescript
// If 3D scene is slow or not working:
const CarScene = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      {/* Basic lighting - keep it simple */}
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />

      {/* Your car model */}
      <CarModel modelPath="/models/car.glb" />

      {/* Basic controls */}
      <OrbitControls />
    </Canvas>
  );
};

// Troubleshooting steps if things aren't working:
// 1. Check browser console for errors
// 2. Make sure model file exists in public/models/
// 3. Try a different/smaller model file
// 4. Test in Chrome or Firefox
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started with 3D Models

### Step 1: Find Basic 3D Models

1. **Download free car models**:
   - Sketchfab (search "car low poly free")
   - Free3D.com
   - TurboSquid (free models)
   - Or use any .glb file you can find

2. **Put models in your project**:
   ```
   public/
   └── models/
       ├── car1.glb
       ├── car2.glb
       └── wheel1.glb
   ```

### Step 2: Basic React Three Fiber Setup

```typescript
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls, useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei';

const CarModel = ({ modelPath }: { modelPath: string }) => {
  const { scene } = useGLTF(modelPath);
  return <primitive object={scene} />;
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}>
      <Canvas>
        <ambientLight />
        <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
        <CarModel modelPath="/models/car1.glb" />
        <OrbitControls />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Step 3: Test It Works

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. You should see a 3D car model
4. You should be able to rotate/zoom with mouse

If it works, you're ready to add the customization features!

## 🎯 Summary for Prototype

### What You Need to Know

1. **Use Chrome or Firefox** for development
2. **Download basic .glb car models** and put them in `public/models/`
3. **Use the basic React Three Fiber setup** shown above
4. **Don't worry about optimization** - just get it working
5. **Test by loading the page** - if you see a 3D car, you're ready!

### Next Steps

Once you have a basic 3D car showing:

1. Add vehicle selection dropdown
2. Add color picker functionality
3. Add wheel swapping
4. Add localStorage to save settings

### No Complex Optimization Needed

For a prototype, skip all the complex performance optimization, browser compatibility matrices, fallback systems, and asset pipelines. Just focus on getting the basic 3D customization working locally!
