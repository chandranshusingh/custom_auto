## **Auto Customizer: Detailed Product Development Plan**

This document provides a phased roadmap for the development of the Auto Customizer platform, from an initial local prototype to a full-featured marketplace, with a focus on a **web-first launch, followed by an Android app**.

### **Phase 1: Local MVP Prototype (Weeks 1-2)**

**Goal:** To validate the core customization concept and user experience using a standalone prototype on a local Windows development machine.

#### **1\. Features & User Stories**

| Feature                  | User Stories                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vehicle Selection**    | As a user, I want to select my car's make, model, year, and trim from a list of popular Indian cars so I can customize the correct vehicle.              |
| **Visual Customization** | As a user, I want to see a realistic visual representation of my car change in real-time as I select different paint colors, wheels, and body kit parts. |
| **Categorized Parts**    | As a user, I want to easily navigate between different part categories so I can modify specific aspects of my car without confusion.                     |

#### **2\. Technical Design & Development Plan**

- **Objective:** Create a single, self-contained HTML file that runs in any modern browser on Windows without a server.
- **Tech Stack:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Tippy.js, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6).
- **Development Plan (2 Weeks):**
  - **Week 1:** Source and edit all layered PNG images; set up HTML structure and styling; implement cascading dropdown logic.
  - **Week 2:** Implement layered image swapping logic; integrate GSAP and Tippy.js; final testing and refinement.

#### **3\. Acceptance Criteria**

- The prototype runs from a single index.html file and all features work correctly.
- All animations are smooth and free of glitches.

### **Phase 2: V1 Public Web Launch (Weeks 3-10)**

**Goal:** To launch a live, web-based version with a true 3D experience and the ability to save builds locally in the browser. **No user accounts will be included in this phase.**

  - **Weeks 3-6:** Set up the Next.js project, implement the 3D scene, and build the core customization UI.
  - **Weeks 7-10:** Implement the "Local Build Saving" and "Social Build Sharing" features. Conduct thorough testing, optimization, and deploy to Vercel.

#### **3\. Acceptance Criteria**

- The 3D car model customization is fluid and works correctly.
- Users can save a build to their browser and reload it on a return visit.
- The application is successfully deployed and publicly accessible.

### **Phase 3: Web Marketplace, Authentication & Testing (Weeks 11-20)**

**Goal:** To evolve the web platform into a full marketplace, introducing e-commerce, user accounts, and a comprehensive testing plan.

| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **E-commerce Functionality**   | As a user, I want to see the price of each part and add it to a shopping cart so I can purchase my custom build.           |
| **User Authentication**        | As a user, I want to create an account with my email and password so I can permanently save my builds and track my orders. |
| **User Profile ("My Garage")** | As a user, I want to view a list of my saved builds and order history in my "My Garage" section.                           |
| **Partner Integration**        | As a user, I want to find and select a verified local garage to have my purchased parts installed.                         |

#### **2\. Technical Design**

- **Backend & Database:** Introduce **PostgreSQL** and use **Next.js API Routes** for server-side logic.
- **Authentication:** Integrate **NextAuth.js** for a simple and secure authentication solution.
- **Payment Gateway:** Integrate with an Indian payment gateway like **Razorpay**.
- **Geolocation:** Use mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps) to help users find nearby partner garages.

#### **3\. Validation & Testing Plan**

| Test Type                    | Tools                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Testing**             | Jest, React Testing Library | To test individual components and functions in isolation (e.g., "does the color picker component update the state correctly?").                                |
| **Integration Testing**      | Jest, React Testing Library | To test the interaction between components (e.g., "does selecting a car part update the total price in the shopping cart?").                                   |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** | Cypress                     | To automate and test complete user journeys from start to finish (e.g., user registers \-\> customizes a car \-\> adds to cart \-\> checks out).               |
| **Performance Testing**      | Lighthouse, WebPageTest     | To analyze load times, responsiveness, and ensure the 3D customizer performs well on various devices and network conditions.                                   |
| **Security Auditing**        | Manual & Automated Scans    | To conduct a security review focusing on payment integration (PCI compliance), user data protection (OWASP Top 10), and preventing common web vulnerabilities. |
| **User Acceptance (UAT)**    | Beta Program                | A closed beta where a select group of real users tests the platform to provide feedback on usability and find bugs before the public launch.                   |

#### **4\. Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can successfully create an account, log in, and save builds to a persistent database.
- The entire e-commerce flow, from adding to cart to a successful payment, is functional and secure.
- All tests in the validation plan are passed.

### **Phase 4: Android App Launch (Post-Marketplace)**

**Goal:** To launch a native **Android app** that mirrors the web experience and adds mobile-exclusive hero features.

#### **1\. Features & User Stories**

| Feature                     | User Stories                                                                                                                                            |
