**Status**: ‚è≥ **NOT RELEVANT** - Beyond prototype scope  
**Timeline**: Post-prototype (if needed)  
**Goal**: These features are NOT needed for the prototype

## üö´ **NOT NEEDED FOR PROTOTYPE**

This phase would include features like:

- React Native mobile app
- AR integration with ARCore
- Mobile 3D performance optimization
- Cross-platform development
- App store deployment

**For the prototype, skip this entirely and focus on Phase 1 basic web-based 3D functionality.**

**Phase 4 is post-prototype. Focus on Phase 1 for the local prototype!**
